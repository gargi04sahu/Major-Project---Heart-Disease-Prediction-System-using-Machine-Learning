    This heart disease prediction system is built using advanced machine learning algorithms trained on 
    clinical data from heart disease patients. The model analyzes various health metrics including age, 
    gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more to provide a comprehensive risk assessment.
    
    ### Key Technologies:
    
    - **Machine Learning**: Our prediction model is built using Random Forest classification, which combines 
      multiple decision trees to provide highly accurate predictions.
    
    - **Data Science**: We use statistical analysis and data visualization techniques to interpret complex 
      health data and present insights in an accessible way.
    
    - **Web Application**: Our interactive web interface is built using Streamlit, making it easy for users 
      to input their health information and receive immediate feedback.
    
    - **Database Integration**: User accounts and prediction history are stored securely in a PostgreSQL 
      database, allowing users to track their heart health over time.
